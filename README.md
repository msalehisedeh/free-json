# Welcome to Free JSON!

Have you ever wanted to have a way of generating and manipulating a complex JSON structure through graphical means?

This library provides Angular 4 components that enables you to create / modify JSON structures through drag/drop, or click/edit just by adding FreeJsonModule into your AppModule.

**NOTE:** If your project still is angular 2, 4, or 5; please luck-down your version reference to flexible table to 1.1.1 version by removing ^ from the version dependency in your package json. Otherwise for Angular 6+, please use 1.1.2 version or higher.

**NOTE:** Starting with version 1.2.1 you need to import this library through @sedeh/free-json.
